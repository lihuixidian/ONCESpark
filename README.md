# ONCESpark
This repository contains the source code for our stream-aware serial pattern mining algorithm, namely ONCESpark, which corresponds to our work, namely Mining the Frequency of Time-constrained Serial Episodes over Massive Data Sequences and Streams, which is to appear in Future Generation Computer Systems.
